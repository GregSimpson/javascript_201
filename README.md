# [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com): JavaScript 201 Workshop (Solutions)

Hey there! Welcome to the `solutions` branch of this workshop. Here you will find reference solutions to the practice exercises for Hack Reactor's JavaScript 201 workshop.

Much like the `master` branch of this repository, solutions are grouped by section. Please navigate into the respective section's folder on this branch to find its exercise solutions.

**IMPORTANT:** Please do not refer to these solutions until you've given each exercise set a valiant effort. Please also note that only the `Basic Requirements` portions for each section may have solutions included.

**On Semantics:** Perfectly valid solutions can be written in a different style than the ones you find here. Please don't feel like your solutions need to have the exact same structure as those found herein; there are often numerous ways to solve the same problem in programming.
